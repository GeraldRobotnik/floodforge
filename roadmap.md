# FloodForge – Roadmap (Intentionally Deferred)

## Current State
FloodForge is preserved as a documented system concept.
Active development is intentionally paused.

This is a sequencing decision, not abandonment.

---

## Activation Criteria
FloodForge may re-enter active development only when **all** of the following are true:

- Primary income stream is stable and predictable
- At least one pilot municipality or partner is identified
- 3–6 months of focused runway is available
- Core responsibilities do not require daily context switching

If these conditions are not met, development does not begin.

---

## Phase 0 – Documentation (Complete)
- One-pager defined
- System architecture captured
- Data sources identified
- Scope boundaries set

No code written by design.

---

## Phase 1 – Pilot Definition (Future)
- Select single river basin
- Use public data sources only
- Define alert thresholds conservatively
- One alert output channel

---

## Phase 2 – Field Validation (Future)
- Deploy limited hardware (if required)
- Observe false positives / negatives
- Refine confidence scoring
- Establish reliability metrics

---

## Phase 3 – Scale Assessment (Future)
- Multi-site replication
- Operational cost modeling
- Governance and maintenance planning
- Funding strategy

---

## Explicit Hold Rule
No engineering, hardware purchases, or partnerships are pursued until activation criteria are met.
