Autonomous flood prediction, detection, and public warning infrastructure

FloodForge

Autonomous Flood Prediction, Detection, and Public Warning Infrastructure

Problem

Flash flooding remains one of the deadliest and least predictable natural hazards in the United States—particularly in regions like Texas Hill Country. Existing systems are fragmented, slow, and reactive:
	•	USGS gauges provide point-in-time data but limited prediction
	•	NOAA forecasts are regional, not hyperlocal
	•	Emergency alerts are often delayed, manual, or inconsistent
	•	Communities rely on social media and anecdotal reports during crises

Lives are lost in the gap between early indicators and actionable warnings.

⸻

Solution

FloodForge is a unified, autonomous flood intelligence and warning platform that:
	1.	Predicts flooding before it starts using weather models, historical data, and machine learning
	2.	Detects flooding as it forms via sensors, satellite data, and APIs
	3.	Confirms events through cross-source verification to reduce false alarms
	4.	Automatically triggers warnings (sirens, lights, voice, mobile alerts) within seconds
	5.	Learns from every event to improve accuracy over time

FloodForge replaces fragmented tools with one integrated system.

System Overview

FloodForge combines four layers:
	1.	Data Ingest
	•	USGS river gauges
	•	NOAA / HRRR weather models
	•	Satellite precipitation data
	•	Optional IoT water-level sensors
	•	Citizen/spotter confirmations (future phase)
	2.	Intelligence Layer
	•	Rule-based thresholds (baseline safety)
	•	Machine learning models for prediction
	•	Cross-source confidence scoring
	3.	Decision Engine
	•	Determines alert severity
	•	Prevents false positives via redundancy
	•	Operates autonomously once deployed
	4.	Warning & Notification
	•	Pole-mounted sirens and strobes
	•	Voice alerts
	•	Mobile and API-based notifications
	•	Municipal dashboard

⸻

Why It’s Different
	•	Predictive, not reactive
	•	Autonomous by default
	•	Designed for small communities, not just major cities
	•	Physical + digital infrastructure, not “just an app”
	•	Resilient (works even when networks are degraded)

⸻

Initial Target Users
	•	Rural and semi-rural municipalities
	•	Counties with flash-flood risk
	•	Emergency management agencies
	•	HOAs and private land developments
	•	Infrastructure operators (bridges, crossings, camps)

⸻

MVP Scope (Intentionally Limited)
	•	One river basin
	•	Existing public data sources only
	•	Simple rule + ML hybrid logic
	•	One alert channel (siren or dashboard)
	•	No consumer mobile app initially

This keeps pilots fast, cheap, and credible.

⸻

Business Model (Later Phase)
	•	SaaS subscription per monitored area
	•	Hardware leasing or purchase
	•	Government grants and disaster-prep funding
	•	Enterprise integrations (utilities, DOTs)

⸻

Current Status
	•	Concept validated through research
	•	Data sources identified
	•	System architecture defined
	•	Not yet in active development by design

FloodForge is intentionally parked pending operational stability elsewhere.

⸻

Founder Perspective

FloodForge is built from the perspective of:
	•	An engineer who works under constraint
	•	A systems thinker focused on failure modes
	•	A builder prioritizing lives over dashboards

⸻

Next Activation Trigger (Defined)

FloodForge re-enters active development when:
	•	Primary income stream is stable
	•	At least one pilot partner is identified
	•	3–6 months of focused runway exists

Until then, it remains preserved—not abandoned.
